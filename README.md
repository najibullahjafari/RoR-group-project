<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Ruby on Rails group project<a name="about-project"></a>

**Ruby on Rails group project** 
The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Note: We are assuming you have pre-installed ruby, WSL, ubuntu and rails!

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

first at all, install rails:

```sh
 gem install rails
```

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/najibullahjafari/RoR-group-project.git
```

### Install

Install this project with:

```sh
  bundle install
```

Setting up the Data Base:

```sh
  rails db:create
  rails db:migrate
  rails db:seed
```

### Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

```sh
  rails server
```

### Run tests

<!-- Test are under construction, but we expect to have them completed soon! -->

Before running tests, ensure you've set up the test database:

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

**Note:** Given that the aim of this project is to test the application's UI, to see if it works without side effects. We have therefore had to modify the contents of certain files, which could have the effect of falsifying certain `Unit` tests.
We therefore recommend that, rather than running all the tests, you only test the `features` folder and run

```sh
bundle exec rspec ./spec/features

```

### Deployment

The deployment will be available soon !
